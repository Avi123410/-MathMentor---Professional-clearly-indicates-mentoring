Your AI math tutor that thinks like a teacher, available 24/7

Project Description:
Math Chatbot Tutor is a simple web-based chatbot application that allows users to ask math-related questions or enter mathematical expressions and receive instant answers. The chatbot uses the Math.js API to evaluate and solve math expressions like basic arithmetic, square roots, powers, and more.

The interface features a clean, minimal chat UI where users can type their queries and get real-time responses from the bot. It’s ideal for quick math assistance through an easy-to-use conversational interface.

How to Run It:

Download the Project Files:
Save the provided HTML code into a file named index.html (or any .html filename you prefer).

Open in a Web Browser:
Simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.) by double-clicking it or right-clicking and choosing “Open with” → your browser.

Use the Chatbot:
Type your math question or expression in the input box at the bottom (e.g., 2+2, sqrt(25), 5*6).
Press Enter or click the Send button.
The bot will reply with the calculated answer using the Math.js API.

Requirements:
An internet connection is needed since the app fetches answers from the online Math.js API.No server or backend setup is required; it is a purely front-end app.
